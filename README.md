# Virtual Responsive Marvel Quiz

Similar to the Akinator game online, this project will be a virtual version of a simple “yes or no” Marvel quiz. Whereby, the Player 1 will pick a Marvel character in mind, from a series of four Marvel hero options and answer, from a series of 5 “yes or no” questions, in order for Player 2 (AI)  to accurately guess which character is the “answer”
